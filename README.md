Overview
Planning a trip can be overwhelming, especially when it comes to budgeting for flights, accommodations, and transportation. That's where Trip Price Prediction steps in. This project leverages machine learning models to provide quick and accurate estimations of travel expenses, helping you plan your perfect getaway with ease.

Features
Multi-city Support: Currently featuring six major cities with plans for expansion.
Dynamic Input Parameters: Quickly adjust trip details such as source and destination cities, days left until departure, hotel ratings, and trip duration to get tailored predictions that fit your budget.
Flight Price Prediction: Utilizes Random Forest Regression to estimate flight prices based on the number of days left until departure.
Hotel Price Estimation: Employs Linear Regression to predict hotel prices, considering factors such as hotel ratings and user reviews.
Transportation Cost Calculation: Determines taxi fares based on predicted distances to landmarks using Random Forest Regression.
How It Works
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and organizes datasets for flights, hotels, and taxi fares.
Model Training: Trains machine learning models using relevant features such as days left until departure, hotel ratings, and distance to landmarks.
User Interaction: Collects user input regarding trip details.
Prediction Generation: Utilizes trained models to predict flight prices, hotel costs, and taxi fares.
Output Presentation: Presents estimated expenses for flights, hotels, and transportation, providing a comprehensive view of the trip's total expense.
Usage
